# Introduction
Hello, my name is Ana Clara Zoppi Serpa. I am currently a Computer Science student at UNICAMP, and I focus on Cryptology for my research. In this repository, I'll be keeping my experiments, code, notes and such things, as a personal backup and also as a source of supporting material for the research community. If you ever have any questions or wish to contact me for any reason, you can send me an e-mail: anaclara.zoppiserpa@gmail.com. Thank you for your attention!
