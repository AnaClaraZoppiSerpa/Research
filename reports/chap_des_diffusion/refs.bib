abstract = {From the Publisher:In October 2000, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology
selected the block cipher Rijndael as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES
is expected to gradually replace the present Data Encryption Standard (DES) as the
most widely applied data encryption technology.|This book by the designers of the
block cipher presents Rijndael from scratch. The underlying mathematics and the wide
trail strategy as the basic design idea are explained in detail and the basics of
differential and linear cryptanalysis are reworked. Subsequent chapters review all
known attacks against the Rijndael structure and deal with implementation and optimization
issues. Finally, other ciphers related to Rijndael are presented.|This volume is THE
authoritative guide to the Rijndael algorithm and AES. Professionals, researchers,
and students active or interested in data encryption will find it a valuable source
of information and reference.}

abstract="A new non-proprietary secret-key block-enciphering algorithm, SAFER K-64 (for Secure And Fast Encryption Routine with a Key of length 64 bits) is described. The blocklength is 64 bits (8 bytes) and only byte operations are used in the processes of encryption and decryption. New cryptographic features in SAFER K-64 include the use of an unorthodox linear transform, called the Pseudo-Hadamard Transform, to achieve the desired ``diffusion'' of small changes in the plaintext or the key over the resulting ciphertext and the use of additive key biases to eliminate the possibility of ``weak keys''. The design principles of K-64 are explained and a program is given, together with examples, to define the encryption algorithm precisely.",

abstract = {If you had to buy just one text on algorithms, Introduction to Algorithms is a magnificent
choice. The book begins by considering the mathematical foundations of the analysis
of algorithms and maintains this mathematical rigor throughout the work. The tools
developed in these opening sections are then applied to sorting, data structures,
graphs, and a variety of selected algorithms including computational geometry, string
algorithms, parallel models of computation, fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), and more.
This book's strength lies in its encyclopedic range, clear exposition, and powerful
analysis. Pseudo-code explanation of the algorithms coupled with proof of their accuracy
makes this book is a great resource on the basic tools used to analyze the performance
of algorithms.}
