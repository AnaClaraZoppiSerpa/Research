selected the block cipher Rijndael as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES
is expected to gradually replace the present Data Encryption Standard (DES) as the
most widely applied data encryption technology.|This book by the designers of the
block cipher presents Rijndael from scratch. The underlying mathematics and the wide
trail strategy as the basic design idea are explained in detail and the basics of
differential and linear cryptanalysis are reworked. Subsequent chapters review all
known attacks against the Rijndael structure and deal with implementation and optimization
issues. Finally, other ciphers related to Rijndael are presented.|This volume is THE
authoritative guide to the Rijndael algorithm and AES. Professionals, researchers,
and students active or interested in data encryption will find it a valuable source
of information and reference.}
